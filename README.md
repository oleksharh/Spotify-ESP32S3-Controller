This project allows you to remotely control song playback and volume. While you might think, “I can just do that with my phone,” you'd be absolutely right. However, the goal of this project is to create a visually appealing device that complements a minimalistic bookshelf speaker setup—just as it does in my room.

Additionally, if you find yourself spending too much time on your phone, as I often do, this device offers a distraction-free solution for managing your music. With no access to social media, it’s a simple yet elegant way to control your audio without the risk of getting sidetracked.

## Setup 
This section will be added as soon as the project is finished.
